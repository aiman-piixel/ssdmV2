<p id="description">Automated python script to submit SSDM submission from StudentQR private server to KPM's SSDM portal for use by Malaysian schools. A follow up to the previous version [here](https://github.com/aiman-piixel/SSDM-Sync-Tools).</p>

  
<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Automated submission of SSDM's submission data
*   Direct integration with StudentQR private server and app
*   Multiprocess on demand for more efficiency

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. This project make use of isolated python environment through Anaconda Distribution. To begin setup go to https://www.anaconda.com/download and download the installer. Follow the instructions in the installer.</p>

<p>2. During Anaconda Distribution installation: (optional)</p>


Check the option to "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable." This ensures that Anaconda's commands are available in your system's command prompt or terminal. Check the option to "Register Anaconda3 as the default Python .." This makes Anaconda3 the default Python interpreter.


<p>3. Open a terminal or Anaconda prompt and run the following command to create a new environment named 'py' with the latest version of Python and use conda again to activate the newly created environment.</p>

```
$ conda create --name py python
$ conda activate py
```

<p>4. While the 'py' environment is active install additional packages using pip3: (make sure you have pip3 installed on your machine)</p>

```
$ pip3 install openpyxl selenium glob2 textdistance
```

<p>5. To use Selenium with Google Chrome you'll need the Chrome WebDriver. Identify the correct version of your Google Chrome's browser so you know which version of the chrome webdriver that you need to install</p>

<p>6. If you are using Chrome version 115 or newer please consult [Chrome for Testing availability dashboard](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/). This page provides convenient JSON endpoints for specific ChromeDriver version downloading. Look for Stable 64-bit version. Save the downloaded ZIP file to your computer.</p>

<p>7. Locate the downloaded ZIP file and extract its contents to a location on your computer (e.g. C:\WebDriver).</p>

<p>8. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows Start menu and select "Edit the system environment variables". Click the "Environment Variables" button. Under "System variables" find the "Path" variable and click "Edit". Click "New" and enter the full path to the directory containing the WebDriver executable (e.g. 'C:\WebDriver'). Click "OK" to close the windows.</p>

<p>9. For the changes to take effect restart your computer.</p>

<p>10. Open a Command Prompt. Type chromedriver and press Enter. If you see output without errors the WebDriver is installed correctly.</p>

<p>11. Now you have the Chrome WebDriver installed and set up on your Windows system. You can use it with Selenium for automated testing and web scraping.</p>
